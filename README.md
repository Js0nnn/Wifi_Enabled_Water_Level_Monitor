### Water Level Monitoring System

#### Description:
This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to monitor the water level in a tank. It provides real-time feedback through an OLED display and integrates with the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control. The system includes functionalities such as:

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor Integration**: The code interfaces with an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance from the sensor to the water surface.

2. **OLED Display Feedback**: An OLED display is employed to visually represent the water level using bitmap graphics. Different bitmaps are displayed corresponding to different water levels.

3. **Buzzer Feedback**: A buzzer is used to provide audible alerts when the water level falls below a predefined threshold.

4. **Blynk Integration**: The system integrates with the Blynk platform, allowing users to monitor the water level remotely through a mobile app.

#### Code Snippets:

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor and OLED Display Setup**:
   - The code initializes the ultrasonic sensor and OLED display, setting up necessary pin configurations and libraries.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop continuously measures the water level using the ultrasonic sensor and updates the OLED display accordingly.
   - It also handles the buzzer functionality and integrates with Blynk for remote monitoring.

3. **Blynk Integration**:
   - Blynk library is used to connect the system to the Blynk platform.
   - Virtual pins are utilized to send water level data to the Blynk app.

#### Usage:
1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the ultrasonic sensor, OLED display, and buzzer to the appropriate pins on the microcontroller.
2. **Blynk Configuration**: Set up a Blynk project and obtain the authentication token.
3. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Arduino code to the microcontroller.
4. **Monitor Water Level**: Access the Blynk app to remotely monitor the water level and receive alerts.

#### Dependencies:
- Adafruit SSD1306 Library: Used for interfacing with the OLED display.
- Blynk Library: Enables communication with the Blynk platform.
- AceButton Library: Provides functionality for handling button events.
